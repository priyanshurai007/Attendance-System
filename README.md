Automated Attendance System by Face Recognition
Achievement

Hi there! , this is a college project made by me , as heading says the aim is to detect ,recognize and mark attendance by face recognition but the project has a lot more objctives:

Detection
Recognition
Updating record in Excel
Managing students data and faculty data through excel by the help of GUI
Notifying students and teachers about attendance statistics via email
- Detection
Detection is done by the help of OpenCV and Haar cascades

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.

- Recognition
Recognition is done by LBPH recogniser

Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.

LBPH is one of the easiest face recognition algorithms. It can represent local features in the images. It is possible to get great results (mainly in a controlled environment). It is robust against monotonic gray scale transformations. It is provided by the OpenCV library (Open Source Computer Vision Library).

- Manage record in Excel files by GUI
By the help of gui CRUD operations can be performed in excel files

- Notifying students and teachers about attendance statistics via email
After recognition code automatically calculates statistics like attendance percentage keeping in all constraints like working days holidays .

- Python libraries used
OpenCV-python
Pandas
Numpy
csv
Pilow
smtplib
calender
holidays
datetime
openpyxl
tkinter
xlrd
